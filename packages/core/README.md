# @bitmachina/dinero-core

> Internals of Dinero.js and shared code between packages.

**This package contains internal functions and common code shared across packages.** Everything you need to use Dinero.js is re-exported in the `@bitmachina/dinero.js` package, so you don't need to ever install `@bitmachina/dinero-core` or care about what's inside. It's only helpful if you're willing to contribute to Dinero.js, or if you're building a different Dinero.js implementation than the one in `@bitmachina/dinero.js`.

```sh
npm install @bitmachina/dinero-core@alpha

# or
